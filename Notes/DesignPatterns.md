## Design Patterns
- Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design

### Singleton Pattern
> *Link to Codes --> [Codes](../Codes/)*

- *Concept* --> Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- *Working* --> Typically involves a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation, a static method to return the single instance, and often lazy initialization.

- *Usage in Spring*
  - **Default Bean Scope** --> By default, all Spring Beans are singletons. 
    - for a given bean definition, the Spring IoC container creates only one shared instance, and all requests for that bean will return the same instance.
